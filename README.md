Deliverables
a. A high-level design of the system which will perform the KPI calculations based on the input raw files and store the result in database. The design should include the high-level blocks of the system and how these interact with each other. The design diagram can be done in a visualization tool or even sketched on paper and then scanned.
b. A simple implementation (source code) written in Python for the calculation and storage of the KPIs. The program should take several 5-minute raw files as the input and store the calculated KPIs in database.
c. Optionally: The design (URLs and response format) of a RESTful API which will provide the KPI data (e.g. for KPIs visualization in a web application). It is preferable that the response body is in JSON.
d. Optionally: A simple implementation of the above API in Python. This can be done in Django or another framework. No HTTP server software (e.g. Apache) is required, since the Django runserver can be used.
